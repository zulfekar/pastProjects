1. 
Using the Python interpreter in an interactive mode, execute the following expressions and show the result of evaluating each expression. If an expression is illegal, explain why.
a. 4.0 / 10.0 + 3.5 * 2
b. 10 % 4 + 6 / 2
c. abs(4 - 20 / 3) ** 3
d. math.sqrt(4.5 - 5.0) + 7 * 3
e. 3 * 10 / 3 + 10 % 3
f. 3L ** 3


2. 
Translate each of the following mathematical expressions into an equivalent Python expression
and execute them using the Python interpreter in an interactive mode.
a.	(3 + 4) * 5
b.	 
c. 4Πr2
d. √(r(cos a)2 + r(sin a)2)
e. y2 – y1


3. 
Write a program to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere given its radius as input. Hint: V = 4/3Πr3, A = 4Πr2


4. 
Write a program that calculates the cost per square centimetre of a circular pizza, given its diameter and price.


5. 
The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at  Rs 25.00 a cup plus cost of delivery. Each order ships for Rs2.50 per cup + Rs 15.00 fixed cost for overhead. Write a program that calculates the cost of an order.


6. 
Two points in a plane are specified using the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Write a program that calculates the slope of a line through two non-vertical points entered by the use.
Hint: m = (y2 – y1)/(x2 – x1)


7. 
Write a program that accepts two points, like in question 6 above, and determines the distance
between them. d = √((x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2)


8. 
The figure below shows a concrete cylindrical pillar with a cylindrical hole in the middle. The hole is of two parts. One part is of height h1, with radius r1, the other part is of height h2, with radius r2. The pillar has height h and radius r. Write a program, that takes as input the values of h, r, h1, r1 and  r2 and calculates the volume of concrete required to construct such a pillar with the given values. 

Note: h = h1 + h2


9. 
Write a program that takes as input the number of students joining each of the programmes offered by the CSE department in a given year, and calculates and displays the percentage of intakes that have joined each of the programmes.
