Question 1

Write a program which asks the user for a number and generates the multiplication table for this
number.
e.g. If the user enters 5, the program should display:
1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
.
.
.
12 * 5 = 60

Question 2

Write a program which continuously asks the user to key in 5 numbers and finds the square root
of these numbers.

Question 3

Write a program which accepts a positive integer from the user and displays the list of integers
from that number to 0 (in descending order).

Question 4

Write a program which uses a for loop to find out the value of a bank deposit, P (input by the
user), after 10 years given that the annual interest on the deposit is 8.5 % (Assuming no
withdrawals are made during those 10 years).
Note that this problem involves the calculation of compound interest.

Question 5

Modify the program in Question 2 such that it stops if the user types in a negative number.

Question 6

Modify your program for Question 4 to use a while loop instead of a for loop.

Question 7

Modify the programs in Questions 4 above so that the number of years and interest rate are also
input by the user. The program must now display the value of the Bank deposit after each year
2
in an appropriate format.

Question 8

Write a program which used nested loops to display the following:

1**1<->2**1<->3**1<->4**1<->5**1
1**2<->2**2<->3**2<->4**2<->5**2
1**3<->2**3<->3**3<->4**3<->5**3


Question 9: 

The Christmas Tree:
Write a program which displays the following given the input below:
When x=1

Output:
*
When x=2

Output:
*
**
When x=3

Output:
*
**
***


Question 9

Modify the program above such that it displays the following:
When x=1

Output:
*
*
**
When x=2

Output:
*
*
**
*
**
***
When x=3

Output:
*
*
**
*
**
***
*
**
***
****
Hint: determine the pattern before writing the code.
